# Feel better to watch videos on your phone

This repo is for an experimental project which targets at making your video experience on mobile phones smoother. 

The **smoother** here means:

- Better resolution (higher PSNR)
- More fluent (higher FPS)
- Loading videos faster (less MB)

This project will need these techniques:

- Video super-resolution - VSR
- Reinforcement learning - PPO
